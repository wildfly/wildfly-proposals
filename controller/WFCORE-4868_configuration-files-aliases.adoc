== Overview

Introduce aliases for standard configuration files

This will allow users to reference the configuration by the suffix or a shorter name instead of typing out the filename.

.Full list of aliases:
|===
|  standalone.xml variant | Alias

| *-full.xml              | full

| *-ha.xml                | ha

| *-full-ha.xml           | fha, full-ha

| *-load-balancer.xml     | lb, load-balancer

| *-microprofile.xml      | mp, microprofile

| *-microprofile-ha.xml   | mpha, microprofile-ha
