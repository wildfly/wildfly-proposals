== Overview

The CommandDispatcher is a construct of the public clustering API for performing cluster command execution.
It is implemented as an abstraction over the JGroups MessageDispatcher mechanism, as well as a local implementation for use in non-clustered environments.
The current API contains synchronous and asynchronous variants of methods for dispatching commands to a single member or all group members.

As of JGroups 4, MessageDispatcher group communication methods were enhanced to leverage JDK8 CompletableFutures.
By exposing the CompletableFuture return types in the CommandDispatcher API itself, we can allow users to easily react to command completion, etc.

An initial consumer of this new behavior will be the CommandDispatcher-based DiscoveryProvider decorator, which can easily feed discovery results by leveraging a whenComplete(...) handler.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* Add methods for single node and group-wide command execution that return CompletableFuture.
* Deprecate existing asynchronous submit*(...) methods that return Future<R>.
** Add default implementations that delegate to the methods returning CompletableFuture.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* Deprecate existing synchronous execute*(...) methods, made redundant by CompletableFuture.join()
** Add default implementations that delegate to the methods returning CompletableFuture.join()

=== Non-Requirements

== Test Plan

Existing CommandDispatcher tests in the clustering testsuite will be adapted to use the new API methods.
