== Overview

WildFly currently supports only count-based eviction for distributed application state.
The algorithm for eviction is not configurable which is not appropriate for distributable timer service.
While this approach works in many scenarios, it presents challenges when server-side state varies significantly in size.
Different session objects, stateful session beans, or timer instances can have vastly different memory footprints,
making it difficult to predict and manage resource usage effectively with count-based limits alone.

This proposal introduces max-idle based eviction configuration for distributable HttpSessions, Stateful Session Beans (SFSBs), and EJB Timers.
This enhancement will provide administrators with more flexible and predictable eviction strategies,
particularly beneficial in distributed computing environments where managing memory and resource utilization is critical.

The implementation will formalize and expand upon previous work done for SFSB passivation
(currently only available downstream or older version of WildFly),
extending these capabilities across the distributed application state management subsystems.

The configuration pertains to Infinispan embedded use-cases.

=== User Stories

As a WildFly administrator, I want to configure eviction based on idle time rather than just cache size,
so that I can better manage memory usage when my sessions and beans have highly variable sizes.

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-20839[WFLY-20839] Remove max-active-timers from default configuration (should be part of this RFE)
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-20842[WFLY-20842] TinyLFU is not appropriate for EJB timer use case (not in the scope of the RFE)

* https://github.com/wildfly-clustering/wildfly-clustering[wildfly-clustering/wildfly-clustering] (already no changes should be required in the manager)

=== Other Interested Projects

=== Relevant Installation Types

* Traditional standalone server (unzipped or provisioned by Galleon)
* Managed domain
* OpenShift Source-to-Image (S2I)
* Bootable jar

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* Provide configuration options for max-idle based eviction for distributable HttpSessions
* Provide configuration options for max-idle based eviction for Stateful Session Beans (SFSBs)
* Provide configuration options for max-idle based eviction for EJB Timers
* Configuration must be available through management model
* The max-idle eviction mechanism must work alongside existing count-based eviction mechanisms
** Documentation must clearly explain the interaction between count-based and idle-time-based eviction when both are configured
* The eviction behavior must be consistent across all three types of distributed state (sessions, SFSBs, timers)

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* Management operations to monitor eviction statistics
(number of evictions, reasons for eviction; however caffeine does not provide this information back to the listener)
* Ability to configure different idle timeouts for different deployment units
(a different bean manager needs to be created with different eviction profile)

=== Non-Requirements

* This proposal does not change the underlying clustering or replication mechanisms
* This proposal does not introduce new eviction algorithms beyond max-idle time-based eviction
* Migration of existing count-based configurations to idle-based configurations or combination of such.

=== Future Work

* Heap-size based eviction policies
* Relative idle timeout independent of the resources available
* Dynamically-adjusted idle timeout thresholds
* Advanced eviction policies combining multiple criteria (size, idle time, access patterns)
* Predictive eviction based on historical usage patterns
* Per-deployment eviction configuration overrides

== Backwards Compatibility

This enhancement maintains full backwards compatibility.
Existing count-based eviction configurations will continue to function as before.
The new max-idle configuration options are additive and optional.

=== Default Configuration

The default configuration will not change.
Count-based eviction limits will remain as the default mechanism.
Administrators must explicitly configure max-idle based eviction if they wish to use it.

=== Importing Existing Configuration

Existing configurations will work without modification.
No changes to the WildFly server migration tool are required, as this is a purely additive feature.

=== Deployments

This feature does not change deployment behavior in incompatible ways.
Applications deployed on servers using the new configuration options will experience eviction based on idle time,
but this should be transparent to the application code,
which should already handle session/SFSB lifecycle events properly.

=== Interoperability

This feature does not impact interoperability.
Eviction is a server-side resource management mechanism that does not affect wire protocols or client interactions.

== Implementation Plan

The implementation can be delivered in parts:

1. Implement max-idle eviction for distributable HttpSessions
2. Implement max-idle eviction for SFSBs
3. Implement max-idle eviction for EJB Timers
4. (optionally) Unified monitoring and management capabilities

Each phase can be potentially delivered independently, simplifying integration to the codebase.

== Admin Clients

This feature will be fully compatible with existing admin clients:

* JBoss CLI will be able to read and write the new max-idle configuration attributes
* HAL (Admin Console) will require updates to expose the new configuration options in the UI

Follow-up issues should be created to track HAL enhancements once the core management model changes are defined.

== Security Considerations

This feature has negligible security impact.
The ability to configure eviction settings is already protected by the existing management RBAC policies.
No new security vulnerabilities are introduced, since eviction is a resource management mechanism that does not expose
or modify application data in any way.

== Test Plan

This feature targets the default stability level and requires comprehensive testing:

* Unit tests for eviction logic verifying that objects are evicted after the configured idle time
* Integration tests verifying correct behavior when both count-based and idle-based eviction are configured
* Integration tests for each distributed state type (HttpSessions, SFSBs, Timers)
* Performance tests to ensure eviction processing does not introduce significant overhead
* Manual testing of edge cases: rapid access patterns preventing eviction, configuration changes at runtime, eviction under load
* Compatibility testing with existing configurations to ensure backwards compatibility
* Management model tests verifying the new attributes are properly exposed via CLI and management API

Testing will verify:

* Objects idle longer than the configured max-idle time are evicted
* Recently accessed objects are not evicted regardless of overall cache size
* Eviction statistics are accurately reported
* Configuration changes take effect without requiring server restart
* Behavior under high concurrency and load conditions

== Community Documentation

Documentation will be added to the WildFly documentation as part of the implementation PR.
Specific sections will cover:

* Configuration of max-idle based eviction for each distributed state type
* Interaction between count-based and idle-based eviction
* Best practices for choosing between eviction strategies
* Monitoring and troubleshooting eviction behavior

== Release Note Content

WildFly now supports max-idle based eviction for distributable HttpSessions, Stateful Session Beans, and EJB Timers.
This provides administrators with more flexible resource management options, particularly useful when distributed state objects have highly variable sizes.
The new configuration allows eviction based on how long an object has been idle, complementing the existing count-based eviction mechanism.
