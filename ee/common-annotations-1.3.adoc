== Requirements

Add conditional support for Common Annotations 1.3 This will be controlled by the `ee8.preview.mode` system property. If
the property is not present or not set to `true` Comon Annotations 1.2 will be used instead.

We need to check if Weld works fine with @Priority changes, which is tracked in https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-9748
