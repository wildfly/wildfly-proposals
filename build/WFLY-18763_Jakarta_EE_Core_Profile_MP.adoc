== Overview

In https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-17648[WFLY-17648] a new `ee-core-profile-server` was introduced. With this
profile a `standalone-core.xml` example configuration file was also introduced. We should have a
`standalone-core-microprofile.xml` example configuration file. This will will effectively be the `ee-core-profile-server`
layer and the `microprofile-platform` layer.

=== Testing By
// Put an x in the relevant field to indicate if testing will be done by Engineering or QE.
// Discuss with QE during the Kickoff state to decide this
* [ ] Engineering

* [x] QE

=== Affected Projects or Components

* Only affects `docs/examples/configs`

=== Other Interested Projects

=== Relevant Installation Types
// Remove the x next to the relevant field if the feature in question is not relevant
// to that kind of WildFly installation
* [x] Traditional standalone server (unzipped or provisioned by Galleon)

* [ ] Managed domain

* [ ] OpenShift s2i

* [ ] Bootable jar

This only affects the traditional server as it's an example configuration.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* The following layers should be included in the example configuration file
** `ee-core-profile-server`
** `microprofile-platform`
* The new configuration file should only be present in the `docs/examples/configs` directory and not directly available
  in default configuration directories.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

* No standard configuration directories will contain this configuration file. It is solely an example.

== Backwards Compatibility

=== Default Configuration

No default configuration changes will be made related to this issue.

=== Importing Existing Configuration

No incompatibility. This is an example configuration only.

=== Deployments

No incompatibility. This is an example configuration only.

=== Interoperability

No incompatibility. This is an example configuration only.

== Security Considerations

The standard WildFly security layer will be provided, along with its standard integration with the other subsystems
(undertow, weld, jaxrs) that are included in the profile. There will be nothing novel here.


== Test Plan

The test plan is that the `standalone-core-microprofile.xml` will be tested in the `ExampleParseAndMarshalModelsTestCase`.

== Community Documentation

There is nothing to document in this case.

== Release Note Content

None.
