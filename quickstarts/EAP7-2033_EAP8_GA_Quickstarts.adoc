== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* The Quickstarts to deliver with EAP 8 GA should:
** Cover EAP 8 GA main functional areas, such as Web apps, Web Services/REST, Database/JPA, Messaging (including remote broker), Transactions and EJBs.
** Be compatible with OpenShift.

* The following EAP 8 Cloud/Provisioning/Testing enhancements should be delivered by at least one of the EAP 8 GA Quickstarts
** Cloud
*** Helm charts may be used to build and deploy an application on OpenShift, with improved user experience compared with the previous S2i usage. Each EAP 8 GA Quickstart should demonstrate how to use Helm Charts to build and deploy the Quickstartâ€™s application on OpenShift.
** Testing
*** The Quickstarts should demonstrate how users may test their applications with JBoss EAP 8, on baremetal and OpenShift environments. Regarding the JBoss EAP 8 GA release the delivered Quickstarts should include integration tests, abstract from the environment where the server is running, and take advantage of Arquillian and the other Quickstarts enhancements to run such tests.
**** On OpenShift the Helm Charts should be used to build and deploy the server with the application, and use Arquillian remote container to run the tests.

* The following existing Quickstarts were reviewed by the developer team and selected for being delivered with EAP 8 GA:
** cmt
*** Main EAP 8 GA functionality covered: Transactions, Messaging
** Ee-security
Main EAP 8 GA functionality covered: EE Security
** Helloworld
