== Overview

The ee-security quickstart is currently a community-only quickstart because it's not part of the EAP quickstarts repo.
Nothing else demonstrates how to configure EE security so this should be added to the EAP quickstarts as well.

////
Delete if not needed. The intent is if you have a complex feature which can 
not be delivered all in one go to suggest the strategy. If your feature falls 
into this category, please mention the Release Coordinators on the pull 
request so they are aware.
////

== Security Considerations

////
Identification if any security implications that may need to be considered with this feature
or a confirmation that there are no security implications to consider.
////

== Test Plan

On the engineering side, manual verification will be done by following
the steps from the quickstart README.

== Community Documentation

The quickstart and its documentation is already in the community.

== Release Note Content
////
Draft verbiage for up to a few sentences on the feature for inclusion in the
Release Note blog article for the release that first includes this feature. 
Example article: http://wildfly.org/news/2018/08/30/WildFly14-Final-Released/.
This content will be edited, so there is no need to make it perfect or discuss
what release it appears in.  "See Overview" is acceptable if the overview is
suitable. For simple features best covered as an item in a bullet-point list 
of features containing a few words on each, use "Bullet point: <The few words>" 
////
A new ee-security quickstart that demonstrates how to configure EE security has been added to the EAP quickstarts.
