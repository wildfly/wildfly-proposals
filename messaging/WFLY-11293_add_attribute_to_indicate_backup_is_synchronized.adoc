== Overview

If HA is configured with replicated journal then it takes some time to backup to synchronize with live server. Once backup is in sync with live then following information appears in server.log:
----
13:20:00,739 INFO  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server] (Thread-3 (ActiveMQ-client-netty-threads-457000966)) AMQ221024: Backup server ActiveMQServerImpl::serverUUID=bc015b34-fd73-11e5-80ca-1b35f669abb8 is synchronized with live-server.
13:20:01,500 INFO  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server] (Thread-2 (ActiveMQ-server-org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server.impl.ActiveMQServerImpl$2@41f992ab-83559664)) AMQ221031: backup announced
----
Reading server logs to see whether backup is in sync is not convenient and user friendly way. By adding a new attribute on the `live` and `backup` nodes the user should be able to know when this synchronization is finished.

=== Affected Projects or Components

* WildFly

=== Other Interested Projects

== Requirements

* Add a boolean `synchronized-with-backup` runtime-only attribute to the https://wildscribe.github.io/WildFly/17.0/subsystem/messaging-activemq/server/ha-policy/replication-master[/subsystem=messaging-activemq//server=*/ha-policy=replication-master].
* Add a boolean `synchronized-with-live` runtime-only attribute to the https://wildscribe.github.io/WildFly/17.0/subsystem/messaging-activemq/server/ha-policy/replication-slave[/subsystem=messaging-activemq//server=*/ha-policy=replication-slave].

=== Hard Requirements

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

== Implementation Plan

Expose `org.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.management.ActiveMQServerControl#isReplicaSync` as it represents the synchronization status of the backup with the live node on each node.

== Test Plan

* Changes in Wildfly management model will be covered in WF testsuite.

== Community Documentation

* Covered by attribute description in management model.
