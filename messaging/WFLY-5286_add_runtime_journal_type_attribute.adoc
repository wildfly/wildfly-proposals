== Overview

When configuring the use of ASYNCIO for journal persistence, the Artemis server may fall back to NIO if the libaio binaries are not located. This state is not displayed to the user so he doesn't know the effective journal type that is used.
Adding a new `runtime-journal-type` attribute to read the effective journal type.

=== Affected Projects or Components

* Wildfly
* ActiveMQ Artemis (finished)

=== Other Interested Projects

== Requirements

* Add a new `runtime-journal-type`read-only attribute to the https://wildscribe.github.io/WildFly/17.0/subsystem/messaging-activemq/server/[/subsystem=messaging-activemq/server resource] to obtain the effective journal type.
The authorized values are 
* *NONE*: persistence disabled
* *NIO*: Java NIO used
* *ASYNCIO*: AsyncIO used with libaio
* *DATABASE*: JDBC persistence


CLI to read the attribute:
----
/subsystem=messaging-activemq/server=default:read-attribute(name=runtime-journal-type)
----

//== Implementation Plan
////
Delete if not needed. The intent is if you have a complex feature which can
not be delivered all in one go to suggest the strategy. If your feature falls
into this category, please mention the Release Coordinators on the pull
request so they are aware.

== Test Plan

* Changes in Wildfly management model will be covered in WF testsuite.
* Checking the effective value on fall back will be tested in WF testsuite.

== Community Documentation

* Covered by attribute description in management model.
