== Requirements

* Add a boolean `use-topology-for-load-balancing` attribute, with a default value set to `true`, to
- the https://wildscribe.github.io/WildFly/16.0/subsystem/messaging-activemq/connection-factory/[/subsystem=messaging-activemq/connection-factory resource]
- the https://wildscribe.github.io/WildFly/16.0/subsystem/messaging-activemq/server/connection-factory[/subsystem=messaging-activemq/server=*/connection-factory resource]
- the https://wildscribe.github.io/WildFly/16.0/subsystem/messaging-activemq/pooled-connection-factory/[/subsystem=messaging-activemq/pooled-connection-factory resource]
- the https://wildscribe.github.io/WildFly/16.0/subsystem/messaging-activemq/server/pooled-connection-factory/[/subsystem=messaging-activemq/server=*/pooled-connection-factory resource]

The load balancing happens on session creation not on messages. The HTTP Upgrade will be load-balanced then the connection will be reused for the full JMS session.
Setting these attributes to false will change the behavior of the obtained connection factory. Instead of using the initial connector to obtain the cluster topology to connect to the cluster it will only use the initial connector for all its connections to the cluster.
