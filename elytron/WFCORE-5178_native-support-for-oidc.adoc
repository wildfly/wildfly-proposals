== Overview

The ability to secure deployments using https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect] (OIDC)
is currently provided by installing a Keycloak
https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/#_jboss_adapter[client adapter].
When Elytron was still in development for WildFly 11, the specifications in use by Keycloak
around OIDC were still very much in a state of ongoing development. Thus, at the time, it made
sense for Keycloak to handle this integration. Since the OIDC specifications are now stable,
it makes sense for individual projects to handle their own OIDC integration. This RFE is to
add native support for OIDC to Elytron. This means that the Keycloak client adapter will
no longer be needed to secure applications deployed to WildFly using OIDC. This will also
greatly simplify other cases where OIDC is used (e.g., bootable JAR).

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

==== HTTP mechanism implementation

A new `HttpServerAuthenticationMechanism` implementation, similar to `org.keycloak.adapters.elytron.KeycloakHttpServerAuthenticationMechanism`,
will be added to WildFly Elytron to provide support for OIDC, as specified in the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html[OpenID Connect Core 1.0 spec].

Like the existing Keycloak client adapter, this new `HttpServerAuthenticationMechanism` implementation will only
support the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth[Authorization Code Flow] and
Authorization Code Flow with https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636[Proof Key for Code Exchange] (PKCE).

==== Token storage

The new HTTP mechanism implementation will be able to make use of a session token store and a cookie token store
to store account info (i.e., access tokens, ID tokens, and refresh tokens).

The session token store will be used by default but it should be possible to specify that the cookie token store
should be used instead.

The new HTTP mechanism implementation will refresh the access token when it is expired. Since the Keycloak client adapter
provides an option to refresh the token on every request, we should provide this option as well but make
sure to document that the use of this option is discouraged since it can have a significant impact on performance.
For more details about what will be documented, see the description of the `always-refresh-token` option
https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/#_refresh_token_each_req[here].

==== New elytron-oidc-client subsystem

A new subsystem, `elytron-oidc-client` will be added to WildFly. Its schema will be similar to the existing
https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/blob/master/adapters/oidc/wildfly/wildfly-subsystem/src/main/resources/schema/wildfly-keycloak_1_1.xsd[keycloak-adapter-subsystem].
The new subsystem will install a `DeploymentUnitProcessor` which will detect if OIDC is required for a deployment.

Like with the existing Keycloak client adapter, the OIDC configuration will be specified via the deployment
or via subsystem configuration. For the deployment case, the OIDC configuration will be specified in a JSON
configuration file in the WEB-INF directory along with the `auth-method`, `OIDC`, specified in the `web.xml`.
For the subsystem case, the `auth-method` won't need to be specified in the `web.xml` file, it will be set
automatically.

Once a deployment has been processed, if its `auth-method` is `OIDC`, the OIDC integration will be activated.
Otherwise, no activation will occur and the deployment will continue to use the existing security capabilities
provided by WildFly.

If the OIDC integration is activated for a deployment, then appropriate module dependencies will be added to
the deployment (e.g., a dependency on the new Elytron OIDC module). This will ensure the activation of the
OIDC HTTP mechanism implementation for the deployment. The deployment will make use of a "Virtual Security Domain",
similar to what was implemented for https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-proposals/blob/master/microprofile/WFLY-12609_MicroProfile_JWT_1_1.adoc#hard-requirements[Microprofile JWT].
This means that it will no longer be necessary to pre-configure SecurityDomains in the Elytron subsystem,
as was required with the Keycloak client adapter.

It should be possible to make use of different OpenID providers with WildFly. While working on the
implementation for this RFE, we should make sure that we aren't including Keycloak-specific configuration, if
possible.

==== New galleon layer for OIDC support

A new Galleon layer, `oidc`, should be added to allow a server to be provisioned with OIDC support.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1_0.html[RP-Initiated Logout] is an optional
OIDC specification that defines how a relying party (RP) can request that an OpenID provider logs
out the end-user. The Keycloak client adapter provides support for this so this is something we
should provide as well but we could possibly look at that as a follow-up to this RFE if necessary.

* The existing Keycloak adapter can also be used to secure the admin console. This requires some
additional work so it might be done as a follow-up task.

* *Migration*: For the most part, the same subsystem attributes and JSON configuration options that could
be used with the `keycloak-adapter-subsystem` and the `keycloak.json` file will still work with the
`elytron-oidc-subsystem` and the `oidc.json` file. The main difference is the actual subsystem name and
the name of the JSON configuration file. That means that the migration tool could potentially detect an
existing `keycloak` subsystem configuration and then change its name to the new subsystem
name instead (and update any attributes/elements if needed). For the deployment side, the migration tool
could detect deployments with `auth-method` set to KEYCLOAK and with a keycloak.json configuration file and
update the `auth-method` to OIDC and rename the configuration file to oidc.json.

=== Non-Requirements

This integration will not be supporting the use of pre-configured SecurityDomains. The purpose of OIDC
is to allow a client to verify the identity of an end-user based on authentication that is performed
by an authorization server. Information about the end-user can be obtained from ID tokens. Scope
information (i.e., role information) can be obtained from access tokens. Thus, we do not need
pre-configured security resources in the Elytron subsystem.

Support for the following optional OIDC specifications are currently non-requirements. These
are also not provided by the Keycloak Java client adapter:

* https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html[Discovery]
* https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html[Dynamic Registration]
* https://openid.net/specs/oauth-v2-multiple-response-types-1_0.html[OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Types]
* https://openid.net/specs/oauth-v2-form-post-response-mode-1_0.html[OAuth 2.0 Form Post Response Mode]
* https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html[Session Management]
* https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-frontchannel-1_0.html[Front-Channel Logout]
* https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html[Back-Channel Logout]
* https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1_0.html[OpenID Connect Federation]

== Test Plan

This will require some discussion with QE to determine the best approach for testing. We will
need to decide if it is acceptable to add dependencies on Keycloak (or another OIDC provider)
to our testsuites or if we need to mock an OIDC provider.

== Community Documentation

A new section will be added to the Elytron documentation that describes:

 * How to activate the OIDC integration for a deployment
 * The new `elytron-oidc-client` subsystem and how to configure it
 * The OIDC configuration properties that can be specified via a JSON file or via subsystem configuration
 * How to use the new Galleon `oidc-client` layer

It would be good to have a quickstart for this. This can be handled under its own RFE.

== Release Note Content

WildFly now provides the ability to secure deployments using OpenID Connect, without needing
to make use of the Keycloak client adapter. It is now possible to make use of other OpenID
Connect providers in addition to Keycloak.
