== Overview

This feature brings support of interoperability of Windows MSDTC  WS transaction implementation with WildFly Narayana.
By our knowledge the Narayana implementation follows the WS-AT/WS-Addressing specification
while the MSDTC interpretation of the spec is extra strict which cause issue in the inter-operable communication.
The feature provides an extension for Narayana WS-AT opening extra endpoints which can be contacted from .NET
in the way the MSDTC interpret the specification and thus fixing the interoperability issue.

=== Background

When the WS-AT (XTS subsystem) is initiated in the Windows side, the Windows client creates a context with the Windows coordinator service and later it calls to the WildFly WS,
the process fails at Registration operation.

The WildFly side tries to execute the Registration operation as a client synchronously and windows just responds `202` (no content, no XML is returned)
which throws a NullPointerException (NPE). The XML sent in the request is the following:

----

Windows implementation does not understand the `http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing/anonymous` as `ReplyTo`. MSDTC enforces the request to send a `ReplyTo`
with a valid `URL` and the Microsoft implementation calls back to that URL with the `RegisterResponse` type.

The anonymous behavior is covered by the standard. The RFC says that some endpoints cannot be located with a meaningful URI; this URI (anonymous) is used
to allow such endpoints to send and receive messages, the precise meaning of this URI is defined by the binding of Addressing to a specific protocol
and/or the context in which the EPR (endpoint reference) is used. Under HTTP/SOAP it is commonly understood that it means synchronous execution
and currently in Narayana the operations of the `WS-Coordination`, `CreateCoordinationContext` and `Register`, are executed synchronously when acting as a client.
Windows implementation is an extreme interpretation of the specification that forces any call to be asynchronous (with that idea any partner,
even an standalone application needs to have endpoints and be a web server too to interact using the WS-Coordination specification).

* Narayana

== Requirements

* The WS-AT handling is feature fix for the Narayana codebase.
* This behaviour should not be enabled by default as it brings a bit different behaviour. A new switch under XTS subsystem is expected.

The goal is providing the XTS WS endpoints being able to communicate back to the MSDTC during registration.
This way it provides fix for interoperability which currently exists while .NET application wants to communicate with application in the WildFly
and use the transaction propagation over WS calls (using WS-AT transactions).

The WildFly XTS subsystem needs to define a new configuration option that manages the registration of the new .NET compatible WS endpoints and making them visible.

* The configuration option is new xml element `<async-registration/>` as part of the XTS subsystem.
* The CLI command defines it with `/subsystem=xts:write-attribute(name=async-registration, value=true); reload`

== Test Plan

Tests are implemented under the Narayana as integration tests using arquillian running under Narayana CI infrastructure
with the WildFly built from the master branch.

The purpose of the added endpoins is to ensure the async registration running from .NET MSDTC is handled.
The test simulate the MSDTC behaviour and verifies if the Narayana works appropriately.
