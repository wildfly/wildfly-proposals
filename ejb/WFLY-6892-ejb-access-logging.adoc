== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* implement the access logging feature similar to WildFly web access logging.

* add access-logging definition to wildfly-ejb3 schema

* configure ejb access logging with CLI

* enable and disable ejb access logging

* configure how to rotate ejb access logs if applicable

** default should be OFF for performance consideration

* configure output location and format

** directory/file

** stdout

* choose from pre-defined logging formats (need to adapt for ejb invocation):

** common (default): %h %l %u %t "%r" %s %b

** combined: %h %l %u %t "%r" %s %b "%{i,Referer}" "%{i,User-Agent}"

* for more customization, define which attributes to include in ejb access logging

** consider adapting the following attributes that are currently supported by web access logging:

    %a - Remote IP address
    %A - Local IP address
    %b - Bytes sent, excluding HTTP headers, or '-' if no bytes were sent
    %B - Bytes sent, excluding HTTP headers
    %h - Remote host name
    %H - Request protocol
    %l - Remote logical username from identd (always returns '-')
    %m - Request method
    %p - Local port
    %q - Query string (excluding the '?' character)
    %r - First line of the request
    %s - HTTP status code of the response
    %t - Date and time, in Common Log Format format
    %u - Remote user that was authenticated
    %U - Requested URL path (ejb invocation equivalent)
    %v - Local server name
    %D - Time taken to process the request, in millis
    %T - Time taken to process the request, in seconds
    %I - current Request thread name (can compare later with stacktraces)

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* users should be able to configure condition/filter to determine which requests to log

* users should be able to configure JSON as the output format for ejb access logging

=== Non-Requirements

* configure ejb access logging from management console


//== Implementation Plan
////
Delete if not needed. The intent is if you have a complex feature which can 
not be delivered all in one go to suggest the strategy. If your feature falls 
into this category, please mention the Release Coordinators on the pull 
request so they are aware.
////
== Test Plan

== Community Documentation
////
Generally a feature should have documentation as part of the PR to wildfly master, or as a follow up PR if the feature is in wildfly-core. In some cases though the documentation belongs more in a component, or does not need any documentation. Indicate which of these will happen.
