== Overview

This proposal defines the changes on the https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-cloud-galleon-pack[WildFly cloud feature pack] and the 
https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-maven-plugin[WildFly Maven Plugin] in order to package and run a WildFly Bootable JAR for the cloud.

=== Relevant Installation Types

* [ ] Managed domain

* [ ] OpenShift s2i

* [x] Bootable jar

== Requirements

* Evolve the WildFly cloud feature-pack to be usable to produce a bootable JAR for WildFly and WildFly Preview using the WildFly Maven Plugin.
* Update the `wildfly:image` plugin goal to produce a Bootable JAR container image.
* Remove the restriction when using WildFly Glow to produce a bootable JAR for the cloud.

=== Hard Requirements

This feature offers identical support to what the https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin[WildFly Bootable JAR Maven Plugin] is offering.

==== Current Bootable JAR support when using the WildFly Maven Plugin

We have introduced a support for Bootable JAR in the WildFly Maven Plugin to address the bare-metal use case. 
Considering that for the cloud, an image containing the server installation built with 
the wildfly-cloud-galleon-pack + the wildfly-s2i + wildfly-runtime image is the way to go.

That seems a very strong limitation. Users want to deploy WildFly Bootable JAR on all platforms 
(as they are doing with the WildFly JAR Maven plugin). 
Running on OpenJDK container image (something that we can do with the WildFly JAR Maven Plugin and WildFly Helm Charts) 
is a very common use-case for executable fat jars.

So we should allow users to use the WildFly Maven Plugin to build Bootable JAR to be run on top of the OpenJDK container images. 
That is also required for the future deprecation of the WildFly JAR Maven Plugin.

==== WildFly and the cloud galleon feature-pack

The `org.wildfly.cloud:wildfly-cloud-galleon-pack` feature-pack introduced for the cloud, 
in addition to adapting the server configuration to the cloud, has a boot sequence  
that allows for execution of bash scripts at server boot to configure the server thanks to env variables. 
Those scripts are run when launching the server in the WildFly S2I builder or runtime images.

This proposal is an evolution of the wildfly-cloud-galleon-pack to also handle the bootable JAR case. In such case, the layer adaption is 
fully relevant, the launch scripts are being ignored.

==== WildFly Preview and the cloud galleon feature-pack

The feature-pack `org.wildfly.cloud:wildfly-preview-cloud-galleon-pack` that is to be used with WildFly Preview benefits from this evolution.
A WildFly Preview Bootable JAR can be provisioned for the cloud.

==== Bootable JAR specifics for the cloud

The following are what is expected to provision and run a bootable JAR for the cloud:

* Galleon layers adjustment to take into account cloud execution context. No changes, existing adaptation is re-used.
* Custom logic run at bootable jar boot time to handle:
** `jboss.node.name` and `jboss.tx.node.id` correct value handling.
** HA, clustering password handling using the env var `JGROUPS_CLUSTER_PASSWORD`. Set the auth password in the correct subsystem configuration.
* Advertise in the well known file `/tmp/wildfly-bootable-jar/install-dir` where the server is installed (required by the WildFly Operator). This implies a change in the 
WildFly Operator to change the well known directory to be `/tmp/wildfly-bootable-jar/install-dir`.

==== Excluding logic executed at boot time

* When provisioning a server installation, the package `org.wildfly.cloud.bootable.runtime` can be excluded.
* When provisioning a bootable JAR, the package `org.wildfly.cloud.launch.scripts` can be excluded.

==== WildFly Maven Plugin configuration

* No changes are expected in the Maven Plugin at provisioning time. The `<bootable-jar>true</bootable-jar>` must be set.
* Glow discovery limitation to only support bare-metal for bootable-jar packaging is removed.
* The `image` goal is evolved to produce an image from the OpenJDK runtime image when packaging a bootable JAR.

Examples of WildFly Maven plugin configuration:

```
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>wildfly-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${version.wildfly.plugin}</version>
  <configuration>
    <feature-packs>
     <feature-pack>
       <location>org.wildfly:wildfly-galleon-pack:${version.wildfly}</location>
     </feature-pack>
     <feature-pack>
       <location>org.wildfly.cloud:wildfly-cloud-galleon-pack:${version.wildfly.cloud.galleon.pack}</location>
     </feature-pack>
    </feature-packs>
    <bootable-jar>true</bootable-jar>
  </configuration>
<plugin>
```

Exclusion of the launch scripts:
```
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>wildfly-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${version.wildfly.plugin}</version>
  <configuration>
    <feature-packs>
     <feature-pack>
       <location>org.wildfly:wildfly-galleon-pack:${version.wildfly}</location>
     </feature-pack>
     <feature-pack>
       <location>org.wildfly.cloud:wildfly-cloud-galleon-pack:${version.wildfly.cloud.galleon.pack}</location>
        <excludedPackages>
          <package>org.wildfly.cloud.launch.scripts</package>
        </excludedPackages>
     </feature-pack>
    </feature-packs>
    <bootable-jar>true</bootable-jar>
  </configuration>
<plugin>
```

Exclusion of the bootable JAR cloud runtime:
```
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>wildfly-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${version.wildfly.plugin}</version>
  <configuration>
    <feature-packs>
     <feature-pack>
       <location>org.wildfly:wildfly-galleon-pack:${version.wildfly}</location>
     </feature-pack>
     <feature-pack>
       <location>org.wildfly.cloud:wildfly-cloud-galleon-pack:${version.wildfly.cloud.galleon.pack}</location>
        <excludedPackages>
          <package>org.wildfly.cloud.bootable.runtime</package>
        </excludedPackages>
     </feature-pack>
    </feature-packs>
  </configuration>
<plugin>
```

=== Implementation notes

==== Boot logic

* The custom logic is defined as a new JBoss Modules module defined the wildfly-cloud-galleon-pack project. 
This module is loaded and its entry-point (ServiceLoader) is executed at server startup. This require an evolution in the WildFly core project.
The service interface `org.wildfly.core.jar.runtime.RuntimeExtension` is discovered and executed at Bootable JAR startup.

==== Container image

That is the image generated from the `image` plugin goal.

* The produced image is by default FROM `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/openjdk-21-runtime`. One can set the existing plugin option `jdkVersion` to `17`.
* The produced image allows user to specify bootable jar arguments (e.g.: `--stability-preview=preview`) using the env variable `JAVA_ARGS`
* The information of where the WildFly server has been unzipped (needed by the WildFly Operator) is stored int the file `/tmp/wildfly-bootable-jar/install-dir` file.

* Provision and check a WildFly Bootable JAR for cloud
* Provision and check a WildFly Preview Bootable JAR for cloud
* Provision with exclusions and check that WildFly installation and WildFly Bootable JAR don't contain the excluded content.
* Provision with exclusions and check that WildFly Preview installation and WildFly Bootable JAR don't contain the excluded content.
* Generation of a container image using the `image` goal.

== Community Documentation

The existing community documentation must be evolved to cover the bootable JAR case.

* Introduce a clear separation in the documentation between the wildfly-s2i case and the bootable JAR case.
* Document the bootable JAR case in details: Make it clear that bash scripts are ignored, 
document the usage of the OpenJDK S2I workflow, document the clustering use case.
