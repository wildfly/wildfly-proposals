== Overview

Newly joined nodes can become overloaded, since they initially report 0% load.
This has been a problem since inception of the project.
The problem is that the initial load stays in effect for performing load-balancing decisions until a new stat interval kicks in.
This effect is mitigated by load decay over time, but for the time a new node joins in, it can get overloaded upon startup.

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-10440[WFLY-10440] Upgrade mod_cluster to 1.4.0.Final

This feature is supported since mod_cluster version 1.4.0.Final and was part of the original upgrade PR,
but was pushed back by QE.

* mod_cluster
* Undertow

=== Other Interested Projects

* JWS

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* Nodes are registered with the configured load to gradually ramp them up.
* The default configuration is that the node is fully loaded (`initial-load="0"`)

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

N/A

=== Non-Requirements

N/A

== Test Plan

QE has already pretested the feature.

== Community Documentation

The upstream documentation for this is submitted with the implementation PR.
Ideally, general documentation for the mod_cluster subsystem will be updated in the near future.
