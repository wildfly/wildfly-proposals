= Introduce deployment option to control async context timeout

__<The entire document should be one to two pages long. We will write each analysis document as if it is a conversation
with a future developer. This requires a good writing style, with full sentences organized into paragraphs. Bullets are
acceptable only for visual style, not as an excuse for writing sentence fragments.>__

== Overview

Undertow allow to set async context timeout as part of deployment. This should also be possible in WFLY. For WFLY undertow will require backport with property instead of API call.

=== User Stories

__<Provide one or more brief user stories that illustrate the intended users of the feature and the goal they will seek
to achieve by using the feature.>__

== Issue Metadata

=== Related Issues

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/UNDERTOW-1870

=== Affected Projects or Components

Undertow integration in WFLY.

=== Other Interested Projects

=== Relevant Installation Types

__<List the installation types that are relevant for the features and remove any that are not relevant>__.

* Traditional standalone server (unzipped or provisioned by Galleon)
* Managed domain
* OpenShift Source-to-Image (S2I)
* Bootable jar

== Requirements

Add ability to configure default per deployment async context timeout. Most likely best place for this is: /subsystem=undertow/servlet-container=default
/subsystem=undertow/servlet-container=default:write-attribute(name="async-context-timeout", value="30000")

=== Changed requirements

__<Only relevant for analyses of a promotion of an existing feature to 'preview' or 'community stability. Other analyses
should remove this section.>__

__<For any existing requirements from the feature being promoted that are being changed or removed, describe the change.>__


=== Non-Requirements

__<Use this section to explicitly discuss things that readers might think are required but which are not required.>__

=== Future Work

__<Use this section to discuss requirements that are not addressed by this proposal but which may be addressed in later proposals.>__

== Backwards Compatibility

Not a problem. Default value will be the same as previously defined(30000ms), just as in previous versions of WFLY.

=== Default Configuration

Yes, this should work.

=== Importing Existing Configuration

Not affected.

=== Deployments

Not affected, defualt value will remain consistent with old versions.

=== Interoperability

Not affected.

== Implementation Plan

__<This section is optional. If you have a complex feature which cannot be delivered all in one go, suggest the strategy.>__

== Admin Clients

Unless HAL generate certain config screens from model definition it will require adjustment in HAL.

== Security Considerations

NA.

[[test_plan]]
== Test Plan

Unit tests included in PR should be enough.

__<Depending on the selected stability level, the appropriate section below should be completed, including a brief
description of how testing is to be performed in accordance with the selected stability level. The non-relevant sections
may be removed as needed.>__
////
Depending on the stability level, the test plan required may vary. See below.
////

** Experimental - No test plan is required. Basic unit / integration tests should be added during development.

** Preview - a brief high-level description of the testing approach should be added here, including types of tests added
(unit, integration, smoke, component, subsystem, etc.) Note that not all test types are required for a particular feature,
so include a description of what is being tested and the approach chosen to perform the testing.

** Community - this level should include everything in the 'Preview' stability level, plus the following additional testing as relevant:
*** Manual tests: briefly describe checks to be performed during one-time exploratory testing. The purpose of this testing
is to check corner cases and other cases that are not worth implementing as automated tests. Typical checks are: bad
configurations are easy to reveal, attribute descriptions and error messages are clear, names are descriptive and consistent
with similar resources, default values are reasonable. If there is an existing quickstart affected by the feature, manual
checks include following the quickstart's guide and verifying functionality.
*** Miscellaneous checks: Manual checks for significant changes in server performance, memory and disk footprint should
be described here. These checks are not always relevant, but consideration of these impacts, and others, are strongly
encouraged and should be described here. Fully qualified test case names should be provided along with a brief description
of what the test is doing.
*** Integration tests - At the 'Community' stability level, complete integration tests should be provided.
*** Compatibility tests - If backwards compatibility is relevant to the feature, then describe how the testing is performed.
** Default - This stability level is reserved and requires approval by a professional Quality Engineer with subject matter expertise.

== Community Documentation

XSD/Model description should be enough. This is simple timeout value so it does not need much explanation.

== Release Note Content

__<Draft verbiage for up to a few sentences on the feature for inclusion in the Release Note blog article for the release
that first includes this feature.__
__Example article: https://www.wildfly.org/news/2024/01/25/WildFly31-Released/.__
__This content will be edited, so there is no need to make it perfect or discuss what release it appears in.>__
