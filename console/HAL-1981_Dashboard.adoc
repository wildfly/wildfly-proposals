== Overview

A dashboard will replace the homepage of the current console. The dashboard should visualize WildFly's most essential data and follow the guidelines from the PatternFly website: https://www.patternfly.org/patterns/dashboard/design-guidelines.

.Dashboard sample
image::https://www.patternfly.org/images/dashboard-view-desktop.d9b02461450d9a4e.png[Dashboard sample]

Different cards visualize the data on the dashboard. These cards include data like:

* Name, version, build, and operation mode of WildFly.
* Runtime information about memory, threads, and other essential resources.
* MicroProfile health status
* Information about deployments
* The last <n> log statements (with errors and warnings highlighted)
* Links to documentation, help, forums, and information on how to get involved with WildFly.

== Issue Metadata

The feature will be part of the next-gen console (https://github.com/hal/foundation/). It won't be available in the current (3.x) codebase.

=== Issue

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/HAL-1981[HAL-1981]

=== Stability Level

* [x] Experimental

* [ ] Preview

* [ ] Community

* [ ] default

=== Dev Contacts

* mailto:{email}[{author}]

=== Testing By

* [x] Engineering

* [ ] QE

=== Affected Projects or Components

* Web Console

=== Relevant Installation Types

* [x] Traditional standalone server (unzipped or provisioned by Galleon)

* [x] Managed domain

* [ ] OpenShift s2i

* [ ] Bootable jar

== Requirements

The dashboard visualizes WildFly's most essential data, including configuration and runtime data and links to valuable resources. Different cards visualize the data on the dashboard.

=== Cards

==== Product info

This card shows WildFly's static and configuration data. This includes name, version, operation mode, stability level, OS/CPU, and JVM information.

*Sources*

* `:read-resource(attributes-only,include-runtime)`
* `:product-info()`
* `/core-service=server-environment:read-resource(include-runtime)`
* `/host=<domain-controller>/core-service=host-environment:read-resource(include-runtime)`

==== Domain

This card is only visible in domain mode and shows the number and status of domain-related resources like profiles, hosts, server groups, and servers. It shows only the number and status of the resources. All other information is available in the topology view.

*Sources*

* `:read-children-names(child-type=profile)`
* `:read-children-names(child-type=server-group)`
* `/host=<host>:read-children-names(child-type=server-config)`
* `:product-info()`

==== Deployments

This card shows the number and status of the deployments. In domain mode this card shows the deployments per server group.

*Sources*

* `:read-children-resources(child-type=deployment,include-runtime,recursive-depth=2)`
* `/server-group=*:read-children-resources(child-type=deployment,include-runtime,recursive-depth=2)`

==== Runtime

This card is only available in standalone mode. It shows memory and thread consumption. Therefore, the https://www.patternfly.org/charts/donut-utilization-chart[utilization] chart is used.

*Sources*

* `/core-service=platform-mbean/type=operating-system:read-resource(attributes-only,include-runtime)`
* `/core-service=platform-mbean/type=runtime:read-resource(attributes-only,include-runtime)`
* `/core-service=platform-mbean/type=memory:read-resource(attributes-only,include-runtime)`
* `/core-service=platform-mbean/type=threading:read-resource(attributes-only,include-runtime)`

==== Log

This card shows the last 50 lines from the `server.log` resp. `host-controller.log` file. If the logging subsystem has been configured to use a different name for the log file, the user can specify another name.

*Sources*

* `/subsystem=logging/log-file=server.log:read-log-file(lines=50,tail)`

==== Health

This card is only available in standalone mode. It uses the MicroProfile Health subsystem to show WildFly's healthiness.

* `/subsystem=microprofile-health-smallrye:check-started`
* `/subsystem=microprofile-health-smallrye:check-ready`
* `/subsystem=microprofile-health-smallrye:check-live`

If the MicroProfile Health subsystem is not available, this card contains information on how to enable it and a link to https://docs.wildfly.org/32/Admin_Guide.html#MicroProfile_Health_SmallRye.

==== Documentation

This card shows links to documentation and other resources. It has two sections:

* General resources
** https://www.wildfly.org[WildFly homepage]
** https://docs.wildfly.org/32/[WildFly documentation] (the link is adjusted to point to the managed WildFly instance)
** https://docs.wildfly.org/32/wildscribe[Model reference] (the link is adjusted to point to the managed WildFly instance)
** https://www.wildfly.org/news/[Latest news]
** https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY[Browse issues]
* Get Help
** https://www.wildfly.org/get-started/[Getting started]
** https://www.wildfly.org/guides/[WildFly Guides]
** https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wildfly[Join the forum]

=== Hard Requirements

Implement the dashboard and the cards for standalone mode.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

Implement domain mode.

=== Future Work

A user might choose from a list of available cards and configure the dashboard according to his needs. However, this might lead to bad UX. The dashboard uses a multi-column layout, and the position and col-span of cards should be chosen wisely.

== Community Documentation

I plan to advertise the feature using various social media channels once the feature has been implemented.

== Release Note Content
