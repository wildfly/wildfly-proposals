== Overview

Customise the title of the management console. A custom title can be specified in the user settings of the console. The title can contain the following placeholders:

- `%n`: The `name` attribute of the the root resource
- `%o`: The `organization` (standalone) resp. `domain-organization` attribute of the the root resource

If the title is not specified, the built in title will be used. If a placeholder is used, but the attribute is undefined, the built in title will be used.

== Requirements

- Add an entry in the user setting to customise the title
- If no title is specified the built in title will be used
- If a title is specified use this title as borwser / tab title
- Replace `%n` with the value of the `name` attribute of the root resource
- Replace `%o` with the value of the `organization` (standalone) resp. `domain-organization` (domain) attribute of the root resource
- If a placeholder resolves to an undefined attribute use the built in title.
- If the `name`, `organization` or `domain-organization` attributes are modified, the console has to be reloaded to reflect the changes in the title.

== Test Plan

TBD
