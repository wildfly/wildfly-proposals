== Overview

This issue summaries the enhancements and new features in HAL 3.x.

=== General

* Place management for finder and applications. Each finder selection and each application has its own distinct URL
** Cross-links between different parts of HAL (configuration ⟷ runtime ⟷ deployment)
* Applications / finder selections can be bookmarked
* Enhanced model browser (visualize deprecated attributes)
* Macro recording
* PatternFly compliance
* Enhanced form items
* Second level cache for metadata (based on IndexDB and web workers)

=== Finder

* Navigation using cursor keys. Open an application by pressing ↵ (enter) and go back with ⌫ (backspace)
* Items are ordered alphabetically by default
* Pin frequently used items to stay at the top
* Filter items by name and by properties like 'enabled' (for data sources) or 'stopped' (for servers)
* Rich preview panes with action links for the most common tasks

=== Applications

* Breadcrumb navigation
* Open in external window
* Expert mode for most of the applications
* New vertical navigation

=== Deployments

* Drag and drop deployments
* Content browser with preview for text files, images and application link
* Create exploded deployments
* CRUD support for exploded deployments:
** Add empty files
** Upload content
** Modify content
** Remove content
* Download deployments / deployment content

=== Configuration

* Client mappings for socket binding (inbound)

==== New Subsystems

* Elytron
* Logging Profiles
* Request Controller
